# Image Classification Web Application

This project implements a Flask-based web application for image classification. Users can upload an image URL, provide candidate labels, and view the predicted label along with a comparison of the confidence scores for the candidate labels. The application uses OpenAI's CLIP model for zero-shot image classification.
## Features

- **Image Upload:** Accepts an image URL provided by the user.
- **Candidate Labels:** Users input up to four labels to classify the uploaded image.
- **Prediction:** Uses the CLIP model to predict the best match for the image among the provided labels.
- **REST API**
